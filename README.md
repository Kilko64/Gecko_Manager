# Gecko Manager

## Objectives

- Be stable and bleedingedge (Want to give user the option)
- Having no bloat (Only what the user chooses even going as far as letting them choose what dependencies use or not)
- Having good tutorials and user friendly
- Have compatibility with .deb appimage flatpack and snap (i dont know if .deb compatibility is really possible, also want the flatpaks and snaps defaults to be on /home if the installator finds one)
- The user can choose the kernel (probably via wifi to let the user search what it needs)
- The user can choose the drivers, an option for every computer driver
- Have a devlog so everyone can see the changes through the time
- Have version for servers for arms and for x86_64
- The user can choose the DE or WM, or even letting users install more than one
- A version for dvd and nethinst
- The user can choose the audio manager
- The user can choose the graphical manager (x11 or wayland (even both sometimes))
- The user can personalize everything and edit everything like a tty directly on the instalation where you can edit even the installator 
- Have custom sounds and themes that you choose (also want to have ones for the system itself but only if the person wants)
- Be 100% open source (can give the option to install non free drivers on the installation withtou needing an usb like debian)
- Fast and light
- Neutral ranged packages (not so bleeding edge and not so old(user can also choose))
- The user can choose the kernel loader such a systemmd and etc
- The user can choose your own package manager (thats the hard part, its almost impossible to do that thats why this is a big challenge)
- The user can choose the way they want to install and also to be friendly with everyone (like people with disabilitys everyone is the same)
