# Gecko Manager

stable and bleedingedge (Want to give user the option)
no bloat (Only what the user chooses even going as far as letting them choose what dependencies use or not)
good tuturials and user friendly
has compatibility with .deb appimage flatpack and snap (i dont know if .deb compatibility is really possible, also want the flatpaks and snaps defaults to be on /home if the installator finds one)
you can choose your own kernel (probably via wifi to let the user search what it needs)
you choose the drivers, tree options one for everycomputer drivers, other for only your computer, other is completely custom
it must has a devlog so everyone can see the changes trhow the time
it has a version for servers for arms and for x86_64
you can choose your DE or WM even letting users install more than one
version for dvd and nethinst
you can choose your audio manager
you can choose your graphical manager (x11 or wayland (even both sometimes))
you can personalize everything and edit everything like a tty directly on the instalation where you can edit even the installator 
custom sounds and themes that you choose (also want to have ones for the system itself but only if the person wants)
100% opensource (can give the option to install non free drivers on the installation withtou needing an usb like debian)
fast and light
neutral ranged packages (not so bleeding edge and not so old(user can also choose))
you choose the kernel loader such a systemmd and etc
you choose your own package manager (thats the hard part, its almost impossible to do that thats why this is a big challenge)
let people choose the way they want to install and also to be friendly with everyone (like people with disabilitys everyone is the same)
