# DEVLOG

A record of all the devs' reflections while making this project.

## 22-04-2025

"First day making this good progress the day, today is 22-04-2025, im tired, its 3 am and i have been working on this since 23:10.

"I kinda reach a point were i need to study very hard, i kinda know what to doo, make the rest of the configurations and etc, but after that im a bit lost im using very much ai to help me, and searching this on web is very hard.

"I also need to learn better how to script bash, i kinda think its funny.

"Anyways im going to sleep, this was day one, i also tried to make this to git but i failed, if somebody was here to help me out that would be so fucking good

"I know this is an ambicious project and it can pretty much change how i view linux and others may too, but i need to keep walking forward tomorrow or when i put the foot on here i'll make the rest of the customization.

"I also want this to be on a usb stick, so i need to find a way to put essential drivers on this so the really heavy and hard part can start.

"Also my pc its shit it doenst work with kvm or somethingthing like that i dont know if thats gonna be a heavy barrier. i also have two other pcs but they are so old they cant have uefi, but they can be good if i want to see if this runs on older hardware 

"Anyways have a goodnight or day i dont know" - Kilko64

"That help came! Hi, i'm Pantuga! Kilko64 told me about this project, and i thought i could help him put it on gitHub, since i already got experience with this.

"I still use windows for most things, and i'm only planning to switch once i get my own PC, but i'm getting really interested in this idea and i think i could help with it.

"My knoledge on Linux and Bash scripts is limited, but i'm hoping to learn from this project. Besides, you never know if a project is gonna be revolutionary or not." - Pantuga

"its kilko talking here now, its 21:30 and i started solidifiyng the gecko manager,im making the v0.2 this is not easy, the one is on git now is the v0.1 when i """"finish"""" or make the v0.2 a bit more usefull i probably put it all there, also i might ask pantuga to make another folder, a folder for older versions he probably knows a way better to do it tought"

"also the v0.2 is coming alive and its so much better, i designed a box thing on cli for better reading, putted debug scripts and info on everything and also planned a lot, created new folders such
Fdrivers thats the folder to pré drivers that need to be preloaded in order to the user to acess wifi via the usb installation, so that drivers are not like the other one on core, also on that folder is also 
many separators like drivers for wifi, drivers for ethernet, drivers for gpu, other stuff, also im adding there another folder just for things like cmake, build, gcc, and gparted, because yes that is tools i need to have locacaly so even if i dont have wifi i could still install the necessary to have wifi"

"i maked like a roadmap for what i need to do, if you cant understand, im not helping you either, but this is more like to me to know what to do next, im putting it here"

"install the pré installed programs that i need for the machine to have wifi (network manager and drivers) let user select the system init, let user select theyr bootloader then let user select the kernel that he wants download that kernel and load sysinit that he choosed, then let him choose the package manager that he wants and download it, then aks him what drivers he want more (this time not only the pré installed ones because he as internet), ask him if he want for all computers or just for their computer, ask them if he wants  to customize the drivers he doenloads and maintans then do the rest of the things that are not so problematic, clean the pré installed shit and programs ask user what to maintain, and when asking making separators like drivers, programs that were used on the installation, and etc, even asking if he wants the default wallpaper for this distro,  and if he wants to delete the old kernel, if he wants then reboot to the second kernel while on the installation when it starts up again and then remove the old kernel"

"also i need to start thinking how do i make the script to create the /home / swap and other configs such as efi partition, im probably doing more on a few time but im going to give it a pause, at 1 am i continue, and yes im better at scripting with bash, i also had a bit difficultyes on finding the stuff and drivers i need to put on fdriver i need to do a lot of wget"

"another thing to have in mind is if im doing a reboot the older core scripts may not work, i might literaly just create them one by one by hand, and another thing, the v0.2 have a lot of comments and the comments have a portuguese version and english one so everybody can modify it, the code inst installing everything yet but its already with 90lines and it doenst use any other scripts on core, oh and right i already maked a new script for storing things to remove later, like i want the user to have full control so it needs that so the system dont comes with packages from the installation im still letting the user decide what packages they want though, and to finish this devlog im also letting you know im probably changing how de configs work, i still need a lot to think, costumization can get to a rabit hole" 

"well thats all for now, im going to rest a bit now all that thinking and scripting got me tired, i come back at 1 am or sooner, now byeeee!" - Kilko64

"its kilko again, imgoing to start working at this in a bit, its now 0:25 and im going to start this at 1 am, just wanted to say an honorable mention to the user Cridr4edri"
"that user called cridr4edri helped me on the grammar errors and catching spelling errors on the git readme and etc, without his help i wouldn't even cared for the errors so thank you cridr4edri for your good english" - Kilko64
