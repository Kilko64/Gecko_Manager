# DEVLOG

A record of all the devs' reflections while making this project.

## 22-04-2025

"First day making this good progress the day, today is 22-04-2025, im tired, its 3 am and i have been working on this since 23:10.

"I kinda reach a point were i need to study very hard, i kinda know what to doo, make the rest of the configurations and etc, but after that im a bit lost im using very much ai to help me, and searching this on web is very hard.

"I also need to learn better how to script bash, i kinda think its funny.

"Anyways im going to sleep, this was day one, i also tried to make this to git but i failed, if somebody was here to help me out that would be so fucking good

"I know this is an ambicious project and it can pretty much change how i view linux and others may too, but i need to keep walking forward tomorrow or when i put the foot on here i'll make the rest of the customization.

"I also want this to be on a usb stick, so i need to find a way to put essential drivers on this so the really heavy and hard part can start.

"Also my pc its shit it doenst work with kvm or somethingthing like that i dont know if thats gonna be a heavy barrier. i also have two other pcs but they are so old they cant have uefi, but they can be good if i want to see if this runs on older hardware 

"Anyways have a goodnight or day i dont know" - Kilko64

"That help came! Hi, i'm Pantuga! Kilko64 told me about this project, and i thought i could help him put it on gitHub, since i already got experience with this.

"I still use windows for most things, and i'm only planning to switch once i get my own PC, but i'm getting really interested in this idea and i think i could help with it.

"My knoledge on Linux and Bash scripts is limited, but i'm hoping to learn from this project. Besides, you never know if a project is gonna be revolutionary or not." - Pantuga
